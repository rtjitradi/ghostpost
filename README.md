# ghostpost
 The GhostPost Machineâ„¢ is a website where people can anonymously post Boasts or Roasts of whatever they want.

Like most services, there is a character limit: 280 characters. We are deliberately not dealing with logins, as that is outside the scope of the project (and beyond our time constraints). 

A front end is necessary to make this work, though it doesn't have to be pretty -- invest as much time as you want into it (assuming your application already has the requested features ðŸ¤“).

 

Your Task
Create a Django application with the following features.

Back end:

One model to represent both boasts and roasts
Boolean to tell whether it's a boast or a roast
CharField to put the content of the post in
IntegerField for up votes
IntegerField for down votes
DateTimeField for submission time
Front end: 

Homepage that displays boasts and roasts, sorted by time submitted (hint --> https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/models/querysets/#order-by (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.)
Buttons to filter the content by either boasts or roasts, sorted by time submitted
Upvote and downvote buttons for each boast and roast
when clicked, these buttons affect the numbers on the relevant post appropriately
Ability to sort content based on vote score (hint: you may need to calculate the vote score) 
Page to submit a boast or a roast
Hints:

button hrefs can use template data, just like everything else
voting is not meant to be secure; this is effectively a proof of concept application
you do not need to worry about figuring out if someone has already voted on something
 

Extra credit (7 points):

Add a post deletion method that works for both boasts and roasts on the detail page. "Wait, how will we delete if it's anonymous?", I hear you ask. When a boast or a roast is created, it should have a random 6 character string associated with it (so that it's hard to guess). Every post now has two URLs... but one is public and one is private. For example, a valid post could have these two URLs:
localhost:8000/posts/1
localhost:8000/posts/abcdef
The one that ends in an ID should display a "public" version of the detail page; just the post itself. The one that ends in the "secret key" should be the same content, but with an additional button that allows you to delete the content. (Hint: have the button link to a different view that can delete a post by ID)
When the object is created, the magic string should be passed back to the front end in a link and given to the user; something like "Keep this link secure; this is your private link for managing this post!"
